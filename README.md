# Description<a name="desc"></a>
During our 8 week span, starting 9/16/24 till 11/11/24, our main goal is to utilize the Pedal method to complete a full website development track, implementing real world systems into our project.
This project has an official client through White River Valley Farms, meaning instead of being our own clients in regard to the usefullness of the app, we will have to be working and answering with the client actively throughout the development cycle.
## Code & Tools<a name="codeTools"></a>
1. We will be utilizing Github as our repository regarding all sprints of this project.
2. Figma will be utilized during Sprint1 to design out a sketch of the site before development starts.
3. React, along with CSS and Javascript will be utilized in the development of the site.
## Sprint 1<a name="S1"></a>
Sprint 1, started as of 10/14/24, will be the overall planning phase of the main project. We will be constantly communicating with our client while we get a rough idea of their expectations for the website, including pages, functionality, styles, scale, etc. Such details will be brought to life in a prototype website designed in Figma.
These details will be tracked actively above in [Client Details](#client-details).
## Sprint 2<a name="S2"></a>
Sprint 2 will be the basic structure of our website built around the functions defined during Sprint 1, along with updated discussions with our client. During this sprint, there won't be any connections between the different pages, nor styling, as the main point of this time is to get a basic set of pages to make sure all planned features will work with it. 
## Sprint 3<a name="S3"></a>
Sprint 3 will be when all the previously made pages, after they are reviewed and match client expectations, will be connected together. Along with this, the pages will have CSS designs from the Figma added to them, along with anything brought up during discussions with Client.
## Sprint 4<a name="S4"></a>
Sprint 4 is, as of current, the "Whatever else we need / want to do" section, along with being where we currently plan on working towards setting up web functionality and getting the site online for the client. This is left to the last sprint because as of current, the idea of publishing is outside of our current scope, as we wish to make sure all other sprint features work before planning shipping.
This sprint will also contain ideas like specialized styling, back end support with setting up an email form for a mailing list system, and other ideas thought up and added to the table below.
| Name | Idea | Details |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Sean G. | Design a built-in admin console to allow client to edit and change items on the site in an easier way. |
| Sean G. | Publishing site on hosting server | Learn how to host a webpage on a server, including getting a domain name, and a hosting site like AWS (Amazon Web Service). |
